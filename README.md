# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project predicts whether a credit card customer will **default** (fail to pay) in the next month using **Machine Learning models**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Credit card default prediction is important for banks and financial institutions to minimize risk and make better lending decisions.  
In this project, we:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on credit card default dataset
- Split data into **training** and **testing**
- Train **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models
- Compare models based on accuracy and evaluation metrics
- Visualize results (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)
- Provide final **business conclusion**

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
